# Data Science Playbooks

The aim of this repo is to collect some examples, tutorials, and code snippets that I found interesting. Input in form of contributions, comments, notes or inputs are welcome at any time.

Currently you can find:
- [Getting started with Piplines's](https://github.com/holzben/data-science-playbooks/blob/main/piplines_v1.ipynb) a small introduction how feature engineering and data transformations can be done using scikit learns pipelines. 


For presenting the material i mainly used Jupiter notebooks, otherwise, an additional readme file will be provided. For running python and R Jupiter notebooks please check the [Jupiter website](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html).
